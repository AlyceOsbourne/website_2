        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! My name is Alyce and I am a self-taught software engineer and web developer with a love for all things tech.
            I have spent countless hours learning a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, and HTML/CSS,
            and have worked on a range of projects, from desktop applications to websites.<br>
            I may not have a degree in computer science, but I like to think that my self-taught skills and relentless curiosity make up for it.

            In my spare time, you can find me tinkering with code, trying out new technologies, or binge-watching the latest
            tech documentaries (because let's be real, who doesn't love a good tech documentary?).<br>
            I am a quick learner and always looking to improve my skills, so if you have a tough problem that needs solving, give me a shout!
            I may not have all the answers, but I'm willing to give it my best shot (and maybe make a few jokes along the way).<br>
            Whether I'm working on a solo project or collaborating with a team, I am committed to delivering high-quality work and exceeding expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My key skills are:
